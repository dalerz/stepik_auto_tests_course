This command updates the index using the current
       content found in the working tree, to prepare the
       content staged for the next commit. It typically
       adds the current content of existing paths as a
       whole, but with some options it can also be used to
       add content with only part of the changes made to
       the working tree files applied, or remove paths that
       do not exist in the working tree anymore.
